# 🐧 .dotfiles | The Scientific-Hacking Environment

### *“Customization is the art of creating a friction-less interface between thought and execution.”*

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for a highly customized Linux environment. Built on top of **bspwm**, this setup is engineered to serve two primary purposes: **Cybersecurity Research** and **Scientific Computing**.

---

## 🏛️ System Philosophy

My environment is designed for **Deep Work**. Every keybinding and workspace is optimized to minimize cognitive load during long sessions of Calculus (Spivak), Linear Algebra (Strang), and Python development.

- **Tiling Logic:** Efficient window management for side-by-side documentation and coding.
- **Minimalism:** No distractions, just the tools required for the task at hand.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensuring a consistent workflow across different machines.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

- **WM:** `bspwm` (Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager).
- **Hotkeys:** `sxhkd` (Simple X Hotkey Daemon).
- **Bar:** `polybar` (Customized with system metrics).
- **Terminal:** `Alacritty` / `Kitty`.
- **Shell:** `Zsh` with custom aliases for Python environments and SSH tunneling.
- **Editor:** `Neovim` (Configured for LaTeX and Python development).
- **Environment:** `Miniconda` for managing scientific and security dependencies.

## 🚀 Transitioning to Scientific-Computing

While originally optimized for **Security Lab** and **Privilege Escalation**, this environment is currently evolving into a **Scientific Workstation**. 

**Key Features for Science:**
- **LaTeX Integration:** Fast compilation for academic notes.
- **Jupyter Support:** Seamless workflow for data visualization with Matplotlib.
- **Deep Work Workspaces:** Dedicated tags for Spivak/Strang study blocks.
